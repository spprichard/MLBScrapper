# MLB Scrapper
What you will find here is all the code used to create a tool for helping you build a better fantasy baseball team. The Application pulls from the MLB Lookup Service (within the bounds of the terms of use found (here)[http://gdx.mlb.com/components/copyright.txt]), and aggregates it in a way that allows for a more informed Fantasy Baseball Team Owner. 

In this workspace you will find playgrounds, and an Xcode Project used to experiment, develop, and deploy this Application
